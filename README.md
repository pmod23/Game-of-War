Play War

The object is to acquire all the cards. To play War, you need the following:

Two players

A standard deck of 52 cards

Start by dealing out the deck one card at a time, so that each player gets 26 cards. Each player turns over one card simultaneously; whoever turns over the highest card picks up the two cards.

The cards have the normal rank from highest to lowest: ace, king, queen, jack, and then 10 through 2.

The game continues in this manner until both players turn over a card of the same rank, at which point you enter a war. A war can progress in one of three ways.

Each player puts a card face-down on top of the tied card and then one face-up. Whoever has the higher face-up card takes all six cards.

Each player puts three face-down cards on the table and one face-up card, so the competition is for ten cards.

Each player puts down cards depending on the rank of the tied cards. If the equal cards are 7s, you each count off seven face-down cards before turning a card over. If the equal cards are kings, queens, or jacks, you turn down 10 cards before flipping one up and squaring off. For an ace, count out 11 face-down cards.

If another tie results, repeat the process until someone achieves a decisive victory.

The game ends when one player has won all 52 cards or does not have enough cards to play war.
